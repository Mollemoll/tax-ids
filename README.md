# tax-ids

TaxIds is a library for validating the syntax and verifying the legitimacy of business tax ids (VAT, GST etc) for various countries.

## Usage

```rust
use tax_ids::TaxId;

// Instantiate a new TaxId object
// Raises an ValidationError if the tax id does not follow country syntax
let tax_id = match TaxId::new("SE556703748501") {
    Ok(tax_id) => tax_id,
    Err(e) => println!("ValidationError: {}", e),
};

// Verify the tax id against the country's tax id database.
// Raises a VerificationError if the tax id is not legitimate
match tax_id.verify() {
    Ok(verified) => println!("Tax id is legitimate: {}", verified),
    Err(e) => println!("VerificationError: {}", e),
};
```
